    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A perfectly adequate, basic pizza recipe. It is at this point in the 
        recipe description that I will enter a long-winded diatribe about how, in the 
        late 1940's, my grandmother was in the middle of saving 16 orphan elephants from 
        eco-terrorist Nazi soldiers in New York's inner city while simultaneously inventing world peace. 
        Unfortunately, she perished on that day and I can still recall the sound of the gunfire I was not present for as 
        all 16 elephants were reduced to atoms. Before she left this planet, she bestowed upon me both 
        the Ark of the Covanent as well as this pizza recipe, which I have cherished deeply ever since. Before I 
        depart for Africa to deliver the bones of those elephants to Egypt, I share this recipe with you now in hopes 
        that you, too, can stop eco-terrorist Nazis from invading inner city New York.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>14.5-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
        <li>1-pound package refridgerated pizza dough</li>
        <li>8 ounces of fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>8 fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
        <li>Love and support from a departed loved one</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 450° F. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes and 
            their juices, the oregano, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and simmer, crushing the tomatoes with a wooden spoon until the 
            sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into one 12- to 14-inch round and place on a baking sheet. 
            Cover with the sauce and top with the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake until the crust is golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with the basil. Slice and divide among individual plates.</li>
        <li>Call a loved one and let them know that they mean a lot to you.</li>
    </ol>
